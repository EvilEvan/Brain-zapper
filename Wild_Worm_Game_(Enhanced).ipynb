Given that `pygame.font.init()` was called, the most likely scenario is an environment specific issue or a Pygame installation that doesn't fully support truetype fonts (though this is rare). The simplest robust fallback is to rely on `pygame.font.SysFont` as the primary method, and the `pygame.font.Font(None)` as the final fallback. I will revert the font loading strategy to prioritize `SysFont` and remove the `truetype` attempt, as this is more likely to work reliably across different Pygame installations, including potentially limited ones like in Pydroid 3.\n",

        "# Refactoring Plan for Pydroid 3 Compatibility and Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "This plan outlines the specific code changes to be made to the Wild Worm Pygame application. The focus is solely on improving performance and compatibility for the Pydroid 3 Android environment, while maintaining identical gameplay.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Optimized Particle Drawing\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem:** The original particle drawing creates a new `pygame.Surface` with `SRCALPHA` for each particle every frame and then blits it. This is computationally expensive, especially with a large number of particles, and can degrade performance on mobile devices.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** Modify the `draw_particles` function to draw particles directly onto the target surface using `pygame.draw.circle`. Alpha blending will be simulated by including the calculated alpha value in the color tuple passed to `pygame.draw.circle`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific Changes:**\n",
        "*   Modify the `draw_particles` function to remove the creation of temporary `pygame.Surface` objects per particle.\n",
        "*   Update the drawing logic within `draw_particles` to use `pygame.draw.circle` with an RGBA color tuple (color `(r, g, b, a)`).\n",
        "*   Keep the existing particle data structure (`particles` list) and the `update_particles` function as they are efficient for updating particle positions and lifetimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** This change significantly reduces the overhead associated with surface creation and blitting, leading to improved frame rates and smoother performance, particularly during particle-heavy events like the level win animation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Manage Dynamic Elements (Particles and Background Snakes)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem:** An unlimited number of particles or a very large number of background snakes could potentially overwhelm the system resources on a mobile device.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** Implement a cap on the maximum number of active particles and ensure the number of background snakes is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific Changes:**\n",
        "*   Introduce a new global constant, `MAX_PARTICLES`, to define the maximum allowed number of particles.\n",
        "*   Modify the `create_particle` function to check `len(particles)` before adding new particles, ensuring the total never exceeds `MAX_PARTICLES`.\n",
        "*   Confirm that the background snake creation logic in `draw_welcome_screen` and `draw_level_select_screen` already includes a limit (e.g., `if len(background_snakes) < 5:`), which is acceptable for this plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** Setting a limit on dynamic elements provides predictable performance by bounding the computational cost of updating and drawing these elements every frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Consistent Font Appearance\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem:** Relying on `pygame.font.SysFont` can lead to inconsistent font appearances or potential errors if specific system fonts are not available on the target Android device or Pydroid 3 setup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution:** Prioritize loading common system fonts using `pygame.font.SysFont` and include a robust fallback to the default Pygame font (`pygame.font.Font(None)`) if system font loading fails. While bundling a `.ttf` font would guarantee exact consistency, this approach offers better compatibility with the Pydroid 3 environment based on previous observations (AttributeError with `truetype`).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Specific Changes:**\n",
        "*   Keep the existing font loading block that attempts to use `pygame.font.SysFont` with names like \"Arial\" and \"Impact\".\n",
        "*   Ensure the `try...except` block correctly catches potential errors during `SysFont` loading and falls back gracefully to `pygame.font.Font(None)` for all required font sizes.\n",
        "*   The `draw_text` function, which handles rendering using the loaded font objects, does not require modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact:** This ensures that the game's text rendering is more reliable on various Pydroid 3 setups, preventing crashes due to missing fonts and providing a more consistent (though not pixel-perfect identical) visual experience compared to relying solely on potentially absent system fonts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Focus\n",
        "\n",
        "This plan is strictly focused on performance and compatibility improvements for the Pydroid 3 environment. No changes are planned for core gameplay mechanics, rules, or the overall visual design (beyond potential minor differences in font rendering due to System Font variations)."

This is likely due to how the Jupyter Notebook environment handles the output of the `code_block` command and the presence of special characters or formatting within the markdown text that interferes with Python's interpretation before it's rendered as markdown. Since I cannot directly control the output format to guarantee it's interpreted as a markdown cell by the environment through the `code_block` command, I will try a different approach. I will indicate the start and end of the markdown content using clear markers within a single `code_block`, and rely on the environment to potentially interpret the content between these markers as markdown when executing the code block. This is a workaround given the limitations encountered. If this also fails to produce a proper markdown cell, I will have to report a failure for this subtask as I have exhausted the available methods for creating a markdown cell via the `code_block` command with complex text content.\n",

            "## 1. Optimized Particle Drawing\n",
            "\n",
            "**Problem:** The original particle drawing creates a new `pygame.Surface` with `SRCALPHA` for each particle every frame and then blits it. This is computationally expensive, especially with a large number of particles, and can degrade performance on mobile devices.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Solution:** Modify the `draw_particles` function to draw particles directly onto the target surface using `pygame.draw.circle`. Alpha blending will be simulated by including the calculated alpha value in the color tuple passed to `pygame.draw.circle`.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Specific Changes:**\n",
            "*   Modify the `draw_particles` function to remove the creation of temporary `pygame.Surface` objects per particle.\n",
            "*   Update the drawing logic within `draw_particles` to use `pygame.draw.circle` with an RGBA color tuple (color `(r, g, b, a)`).\n",
            "*   Keep the existing particle data structure (`particles` list) and the `update_particles` function as they are efficient for updating particle positions and lifetimes.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Impact:** This change significantly reduces the overhead associated with surface creation and blitting, leading to improved frame rates and smoother performance, particularly during particle-heavy events like the level win animation.\n",

            "## 2. Manage Dynamic Elements (Particles and Background Snakes)\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "**Solution:** Implement a cap on the maximum number of active particles and ensure the number of background snakes is limited.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Specific Changes:**\n",
            "*   Introduce a new global constant, `MAX_PARTICLES`, to define the maximum allowed number of particles.\n",
            "*   Modify the `create_particle` function to check `len(particles)` before adding new particles, ensuring the total never exceeds `MAX_PARTICLES`.\n",
            "*   Confirm that the background snake creation logic in `draw_welcome_screen` and `draw_level_select_screen` already includes a limit (e.g., `if len(background_snakes) < 5:`), which is acceptable for this plan.\n",
            "\n",
